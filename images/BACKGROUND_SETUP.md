# Background Image Setup

## How to Add the Form Background Image

1. **Download the image from Pinterest:**
   - Go to: https://pin.it/3MESWWX0V
   - Right-click on the image
   - Select "Save image as..." or "Download image"

2. **Save to images folder:**
   - Save the image as: `form-background.jpg`
   - Place it in: `images/form-background.jpg`

3. **Supported formats:**
   - JPG/JPEG (recommended - name it `form-background.jpg`)
   - PNG (name it `form-background.png`)
   - The CSS will automatically use it once the file is in place

4. **If using a different filename:**
   - Update `css/style.css` line 33
   - Change `url('../images/form-background.jpg')` to your filename

## Current Setup

The login/registration forms now have:
- Background image with overlay gradient
- Fallback gradient if image is not found
- Professional appearance with the military theme

The background will automatically appear once you add the image file!
